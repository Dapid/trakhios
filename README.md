# trakhios
Trakhios (Τραχιοσ), one of the four younger cyclopes, has recently changed his life to work for scientist, watching at fast events, and following marked elements through his CCD eye.

With this project, we will analyze the behavior of mechanical systems to a top level of detail, without interfering materially with it. The only needs are a camera and some visual spots.
